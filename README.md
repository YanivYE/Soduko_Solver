# Soduko_Solver

In this project I have created my own Sudoku Solver program. It is based on ML and image processing. 

The insperation came from a cool project i found online and found interesting to develop myself.
Vesrion 1.0.0 of my project is based on the following tutorials: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOXDoYUgNlU
                                                                 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1ZrOs9s2QA
                                                                 
after failing to get a perfect accuracy at my digits classification i have decided to come up with:
Version 2.0.0 of my project which was inspired by this facinating article: https://pyimagesearch.com/2020/08/10/opencv-sudoku-solver-and-ocr/

Hopfely Version 3.0.0 is soon to come out including more Graphic designs for better UX :)
